# Week Nine

## Monday

I taught class today.

Here's what I've prepared:

- Creating Secrets out of the SSL keys, and adding them to both the kubernetes enviroment and removing them from the docker image.
- Setting up the docker image so it can be run in a kubernetes pod.
- Building and pushing the docker image to DockerHub.
- Changing the YAML file so it can pull and run the docker image.
- Creating the kubernetes pod again.
