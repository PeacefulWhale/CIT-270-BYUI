# Week Eleven

## Monday

Today we made sure that the servers were up and running, and updated billing information for the kubernetes thing because some groups are running low on funds.

For some reason my docker image isn't copying over the `public` folder... weird...

Hmmm... and when I build and push again it can't find the `preferences.json` file... wack.

Let's see if I can fix these...

Okay, the pod is back up and running... but I'm still not seeing the public folder...

I'll try to fix that later I guess.

They also started working on fixing redis... I should definitely start my own redis server back up and running.

I'll add my `preferences.json` to the kubernetes secrets thing and put the redis server IP / user / password in that.

Sometime soon, maybe I'll do it over the break.
