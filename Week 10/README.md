# Week Ten

## Monday

I think that most of the class has caught up to having their load balancer deployments up and running, but I'm not sure if they've got the DNS records set properly (but that's super easy so they'll probably get that done near instantly).

I think I should probably take a look at getting the redis server actually up and running, instead of just smacking it into the deployment (which get purged often lol. I'm sure that's exactly what you want for your user database).

Actually it appears that I was wrong, the class has not yet gotten this far...

I'll finish some homework while they catch up.

I really should work on the redis server but I'm lazy right now, and we might set it up as a class later as a kubernetes thing.

Okay, they've gotten to the DNS part now, and there's 30 minutes left in class, so we should be able to start something after this.

And nope, too many people with errors and nonresponsive servers... I guess we'll continue this Wednesday.

## Wednesday

Today we are getting it so our POST scripts from earlier can work now.

My scripts work and stuff, so that's good.

But the only reason why this is working is probably because I'm running the redis server inside of my pods (which I think is terrible practice ;_;).

I'll fix this eventually... Sometime... Probably ;_;

The rest of the class spent today getting their stuff up and running.
